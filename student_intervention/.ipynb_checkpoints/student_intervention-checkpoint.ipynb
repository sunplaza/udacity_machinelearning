In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "Out of three choices, I would use Supporting Vector Machine. Despite of it's longer time to train and predict, F1 Score for the test set is highest for all number of training set size. Since the data set is relatively small (i.e. the number of students in the database will be limited to the number of students in the county), training time and prediction time most likely won't be a significant factor for choosing the best model. As a result, the best prediction value that a model can support wil be the best model for its use."

    "My recommendation for a model to predict who need intervention before they drop out of school is based on a supporting vector machine. Don't get surprised by this big jargon. Practically, this model allows us to predict whether a student will have a chance to pass based on previous students achievements. We characterized each student based on certain features (e.g. gender, age, family size, parents' occupation, study time, free time, health). We tried to find a trend based on these features to predict one's chance to pass the school curriculum. Although this model does not allow us to predict with 100% accuracy, we are confident that it can help us to predict which student needs to have intervention than a random selection."
